# Write out the dconf database recursively as plain text, starting from the root:
# dconf dump / > ~/.config/dconf/user.d/everything.conf

# Load back in:
# cat ~/.config/dconf/user.d/*.dconf | dconf load /
#
# dconf watch /
# to see all the configuration changes as they happen, then change
# something in the GUI to find out where the relevant setting is.
